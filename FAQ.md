* **Who made this?**

Thanks for asking. I did. I am a writer of raunchy stories with a sideline in computer stuff. You can find all my links and stories [here](https://nushara.com/pickleherring/links) (be warned, my web pages are NSFW!). If you want to tweet your results from the eroticabulary app you are welcome to tag me [@prehensileballs](https://twitter.com/prehensileballs).

* **How did you make this?**

You can see the source code for the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/pickleherring/eroticabulary).

* **What is the Literotica corpus?**

The Literotica corpus is a large sample of writing that I have collected from [literotica.com](https://www.literotica.com/s/new-lit-story-page-beta-font-customization-now-available). It consists of the text of the 50 top-rated stories in each of the site's 24 main categories, so 1200 stories in total.
