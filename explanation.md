Each point on the plot represents one word. (Only a few of them are labeled, because labeling them all would result in a huge mess.) The horizontal axis shows a measure of how often the word is used in the Literotica corpus. The vertical axis shows how often the word is used in your writing. If a point lies exactly on the diagonal dashed line, this means that the word is used equally often in your sample and in the Literotica corpus. To the extent that your word choices are similar to those in the Literotica corpus, the points will be placed along this line.

Words that appear above the line are words that you use **more frequently** than Literotica writers. Words that appear below the line are words that you use **less frequently** than Literotica writers. The words that you use most differently have been labeled.
